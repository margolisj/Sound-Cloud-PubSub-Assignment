# Soundcloud Pub Sub Interview Programming Challenge

This was an interviewprogramming assignment I completed for a Soundcloud interview. I don't remember signing any NDA etc. so I'm posting my solution now. The assignment required one to use only default libraries for a solution, although, I used Mocha for testing. This is ES6 code and needs to be run with an ES6 compliant version of node.

## How to Run

### Execute

```node index.js```

### Test

```npm test```
